Scrape and clean Sepohora products and ingredients data - by Mai Doan and Phan Nguyen  

This is a project where we tried to collect all Sephora products and their ingredients data.  
We developed a small Python scraper, to go to Sephora website, go through each product page and scrape data.    
The scraper is based on Jennifer Ruddock's [article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/scraping-sephora-an-ingredients-analysis/) and [repo](https://github.com/chemjen/skincare_scraping)

To run scraper: Run get_brand_list.py then get_products_list.py then sephora.py
